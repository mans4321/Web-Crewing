We have been very excited for its launch and look forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions. In the meantime, I wish to write a few words as we head into the new fall semester.", "One of the roles of the President and Executive of CUFA is to ensure that our Collective Agreement (CA) is being followed by the Employer. We also work on a daily basis at improving our working conditions, and dealing with various issues and concerns as they come up. With the current Agreement expiring on May 31, 2015, the next round of negotiations are just around the corner, possibly starting as early as summer 2014. The CUFA Executive has already begun its preliminary negotiations work with discussions towards the next round of bargaining that will continue during the year in both a philosophical and practical way. After all, a Collective Agreement is a long and evolving work in progress; there is no reason to discuss it only during formal negotiations. To this end, the Executive will, as always, consult the membership over the coming months seeking new ideas and input that could shape our future contract(s). In view of how unnecessarily long the last few rounds of negotiations have dragged on, however, we will of course try to limit the number of Articles to be opened and insist that both sides justify any and all Articles put on the table. Hopefully this will expedite formal negotiations and avoid any unnecessary delays.", "Another role of the Executive, although not officially so, is to be aware of and monitor the decision-making process regarding appointments of academic administrators, discussions and decisions of Senate and the Board of Governors, and of course, to react to and encourage comments by our membership with regard to our academic direction. Accordingly, we invite members to contact us if they become aware of any situation at the university that raises a red flag; CUFA can inquire and act if necessary.", "In short, perhaps the most important role of the CUFA Executive is to foster our own empowerment, as individuals and as a bargaining unit, with a view to a better future for us collectively, and for higher education in Qu\u00e9bec more broadly. In the recent past, we have amply proven our power\u00a0 and potential as a union \u2013 with the constitutional amendment in 2008, making CUFA strike action a real possibility. This happened during the governance crisis in 2011, in demanding a second iteration of the Academic Plan in 2011 as well, and of course the overwhelming vote in favour of giving the Executive a strike mandate \u2013 the first in CUFA\u2019s history \u2013 just last year (2013). As we said at the time, that strong mandate sent the Employer a message that was loud and clear; it was instrumental in reaching a settlement after more than 15 months of unpleasant negotiations. It was instrumental in ensuring that the next and future rounds of bargaining do not drag on again.", "While critical for sending the Employer a message that CUFA stands tall, these achievements of the last few years are only part of the equation. Looking ahead, our union can only be as strong as your", "ongoing", "involvement. We\u2019ve repeatedly shown the Employer we are capable of pulling together when times get tough; imagine the message we send by mobilizing in solidarity during the quiet times too. Let\u2019s not wait for the next crisis at the University; by continuing to stand up together, maybe there won\u2019t be a next crisis at all.", "With all best wishes in the new academic year.", "Montreal, September, 2013", "CUFA Member Suggestion Box", "Have a suggestion about negotiations or something else?", "Please share your input with us!", "November 2017", "Previous Month", "Next Month", "S", "M", "T", "W", "T", "F", "S", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "CUFA Council Meeting", "9:30am - 11:25am / S-MB 9A", "6", "7", "8", "9", "Senate", "2:00pm - 5:00pm / EV-2.260", "10", "11", "12", "CUFA Executive Meeting", "12:00pm - 2:00pm / SGW TBD", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17", "18", "19", "20", "21", "22", "CUFA 5 \u00e0 7 \u2013 November 23, 2017", "5:00pm - 7:00pm / JMSB Building, 9th Floor Rooms C and D", "23", "24", "25", "26", "CUFA Executive Meeting", "10:00am - 12:00pm / L-HB109", "27", "28", "29", "30", "On Twitter", "CUFA/APUC", "@cufa_apuc", "https://t.co/6nardwZ6Pq", "Sunday, November 5", "CUFA/APUC", "@cufa_apuc", "In a Volatile Climate on Campus, Professors Teach on Tenterhooks", "https://t.co/l0q7JJLHst", "Sunday, November 5", "CUFA/APUC", "@cufa_apuc", "https://t.co/syt4neq01z", "Wednesday, October 18", "Latest News", "Support for Professor Louise Briand, faculty representative on the UQO Board of Governors", "Read the letter of support from the FQPPU", "U Can\u2019t Talk to Ur Professor Like This \u2013 The New York Times", "Read the full story", "March for Science \u2013 April 22 12:00 pm", "View details about the March", "Canadian Messaging \u2013 March for Science", "Conferences are intellectual lifelines \u2013 but as a single parent I often miss out", "Read the full story", "New study suggests female professors outperform men in terms of service", "Read the full story", "Contact Information", "General Inquiries", "Chantal Bohbot: 514-848-2424 x3999 |", "Inquiries about the Collective Agreement", "Genevieve Robichaud: 514-848-2424 x3984 |", "View the Staff Directory \u00bb", "Mailing Address:", "Hingston Hall", "7141 Sherbrooke Street West", "Montreal, H4B 1R6", "Fax:", "(514) 848-3997", "Copyright \u00a9 2007-2014 Concordia University Faculty Association.", "Contact the website developer \u00bb"]}

Concordia University Dean of Students Office and Student Parents Centre outlined a lack of support for student parents at the University. Four years later, the situation has not improved\u2014something the Concordia Student Union (CSU) is trying to change.", "The study stated that many student parents did not have access to \u201cflexible, affordable childcare that would allow them to attend classes, given that subsidized daycare waiting lists can be up to four years, and that private child care can cost upwards of $30 a day.\u201d", "Another issue cited in the study, entitled \u201cStudent parents and their children: how can we help them?\u201d was that not a lot of childcare is available in the evenings, when many student parents take classes\u2014all this on top of a lack of financial resources.", "Over the summer, Terry Wilkings, CSU VP Academic & Advocacy, met with the director of the Concordia Student Parents Centre, where he came across the aforementioned study. \u201cAfter reading the recommendations and realizing that the university hasn\u2019t taken any concrete steps to support student parents in providing childcare services, the decision was made that the CSU must take action,\u201d said Wilkings. \u201cI believe it\u2019s the role of the CSU to support students in achieving academic success; clearly, a lack of accessible childcare services is a major barrier that contributes to the difficulties student parents face while studying Concordia. Also, student unions at McGill, U de M and Laval already provide these services for their student parents.\u201d", "Back in September, CSU Council put through funding to determine whether or not opening a daycare would be possible. Wilkings explained that the research looked at \u201clogistical, policy and budgetary needs for grants, subsidies, and government permits to operate.\u201d The research also looked at how many children could be taken per year (there are three different proposals, one with 24 children, one with 50, and one with 80\u2014this will all depend on startup and annual costs, as well as the physical space available); whether it would be possible to support children until they are 12 years old; \u00a0and what process would have to be followed so that the daycare could qualify as a CPE (centre de la petite enfance\u2014roughly, early childhood centres). The scenarios all included evening care.", "According to CUSP, about 10 per cent of Concordia\u2019s students are also parents. Malene Bodington, who authored the study, works for the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and is a former student parent at Concordia, was surprised to find out that other students were dealing with the same difficulties she was. \u201cI guess I thought my experiences were unique. To find that they were so common among student parents, and to see that for many it was much worse, was an eye opener,\u201d she said.", "When Bodington was a student, she and her husband had no family around to help take care of their son, and finding an affordable daycare turned out to be quite the challenge, despite tax deductions. \u201cIt was a mouthful to find $225 every week. It also took a long time to find a spot, so I was home with him for longer than we had anticipated,\u201d she said.", "The study also pointed out some of the issues with Concordia\u2019s current daycare system. At Les P\u2019tits profs, the Loyola campus\u2019 daycare, only staff, students, and faculty who are at Concordia full-time can apply. The daycare takes 12 to 14 children a year (aged between three months and five years), and the waiting period is about two years. Evening daycare is not offered. \u00a0This is also the issue at the downtown daycare, the Centre de la Petite Enfance. \u201cConsidering the life-cycle of students, and the fact that children require supervision until they are much older than 5, these bureaucratic and practical hurdles are significant issues with Concordia current childcare services,\u201d Wilkings said.", "The CSU now finds itself at the point where they must discuss this project with the university. Wilkings is also waiting on the student body\u2019s consultation via referendum before any moves are made.", "Concordia President Alan Shepard would love to see more daycares for student parents. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about a drop-in day care. I\u2019m not talking about a daycare where you can bring in [the children] \u2026 while you attend a class or go to the lab and so on. We\u2019re talking about a much more episodic daycare. I think that would keep students, particularly part-time students, accelerate their progress towards their degree. It must be the case that if you have a young kid, or kids, at home, they come first,\u201d Shepard said.", "On Nov. 25 to 27, undergraduate students will be able to vote on whether or not to approve \u201cthe continued prioritization and active support of the establishment of a Daycare Centre as an initiative to improve student space on campus through the student space, accessible education and legal contingency fund.\u201d", "Lending a hand to student parents", "was last modified:", "December 9th, 2014", "by", "Nathalie Laflamme", "Daycare", "0 comment", "1", "Facebook", "Twitter", "Google +", "Pinterest", "Nathalie Laflamme", "previous post", "CSU gets serious on student housing", "next post", "Letter to the Editor: VOTE YES for Model UN", "Related Articles", "Jonathan Roy named ASFA president", "November 24, 2017", "CSU finance coordinator resigns for personal reasons", "November 22, 2017", "Reggies\u2019s board of directors projects $6,000 deficit...", "November 22, 2017", "Make room for the millennial", "November 21, 2017", "Facebook", "Twitter", "Instagram", "Youtube", "RSS", "\u00a9 Copyright 2017, All Rights Reserved.", "Back To Top"]}

sanctuaries and conservation centers as better options. The truth is, accredited zoos and aquariums are both sanctuaries and conservation centers.", "Webster defines a sanctuary as a place where someone or something is protected and given shelter. \u00a0All accredited zoos and aquariums have rigorous welfare and regulatory standards and can point to an excellent record of having healthy, long-lived animals in their care. \u00a0We are in the midst of what has been identified as the 6th extinction. The rate of extinction has increased a hundred-fold in the last century with over 18,000+ species facing oblivion. As we work together to mitigate threats, zoos provide a safe haven for species under threat.", "Conservation can be defined as the protection and preservation of natural ecosystems and wildlife. \u00a0Accredited zoos and aquariums conduct and contribute to active programs that aid species survival, research and conservation, both at home and in the wild. \u00a0Zoos collectively are spending $350 million annually to ensure the future of highly endangered species in the wild. \u00a0This contribution rivals partner conservation organizations, such as the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy. \u00a0Our zoo has been instrumental in the developmental of wildlife reserves in Armenia, Peru, Kenya and Niger. Locally we have restored approximately 170 acres of native pollinator habitat. \u00a0We have worked with international and regional agencies to reintroduce Partula snails to Tahiti, scimitar-horned oryx to Chad, and American burying beetles and hellbenders to our state\u2013Missouri.", "The writer also challenges the important role zoos play in educating the public. \u00a0Today, well over 50 percent of our populations live in cities. We are rapidly becoming divorced from the realities of the natural world. \u00a0Every year, over 700 million visits are made to zoos and aquariums that are members of national or regional associations around the world. \u00a0Our zoo alone is annually visited by over 3 million people.

Marie, Mich.)", "Tweet", "Change text size for the story", "Print", "Report an error", "GARDEN RIVER FIRST NATION\u00a0-", "In July 1839, the small Sault Ste Marie community was scandalized when a Baptist mission interpreter, Mary Rice, eloped with the \u201chalf-breed\u201d widower George Johnston. Both worked for the mission: Rice as a school teacher and Johnston as an occasional interpreter for the Rev. Abel Bingham.\u00a0 Rice was 36 and Johnston was 43 at the time of their marriage.\u00a0 Rice\u2019s untimely death on Sept. 25, 1858, of cancer left George to care for their four children. Johnston\u2019s health and lifestyle rapidly declined after Mary\u2019s death. He eventually froze to death on a walk in January 1861.", "George Johnston, born on April 10, 1796, spent most of his life in the Upper Great Lakes, other than an educational sojourn in Montreal. From his return to the Sault just before the outbreak of War in 1812 until his death in 1861, Johnston held a variety of government positions for the United States, Chippewa County, as well as Canada West such as interpreter, teacher, Indian agent, carpenter, and justice of the peace. Additionally, Johnston operated stores or trading posts for instance in the Sault region, Grand Traverse, and La Pointe. He also acted as a mineral speculator and part-time translator of sermons, hymns, and scripture for various missions in the Sault and Grand Traverse regions as well as for individuals seeking to communicate with the Anishinaabeg.", "Mary Rice was born on Oct. 31 1802 in Boston, Mass. Rice worked as a Baptist mission assistant from 1830 to 1834 in Sault Ste. Marie before being transferred to the Western Creek Nation mission.\u00a0 Here she worked from 1834 until 1836.\u00a0 Both transfers from the Sault mission to the Western Creek mission and back again were supposedly to alleviate health issues. Rev. Bingham initiated the first transfer claiming that he feared Rice had contracted tuberculosis. The move from the Creek station back to the Sault appears to have been initiated by Rice in an effort to escape from a situation that left her constantly ill and in care of the mission family. At both missions Rice worked as an assistant in the Sunday schools, teacher of the female day scholars, and general assistant in the mission houses. Judging from her correspondence, Rice was well educated, well liked, and committed to educating and Christianizing Indigenous peoples. Her faith and goals were also tempered by a loving humanity for the children the Indigenous parents placed in her care. Her employers often described her as being well liked, \u201cbright, capable and energetic.\u201d", "The Baptist mission to the Sault, launched in 1828 under the auspices of Rev. Abel Bingham, came into existence under the terms of the 1826 Treaty of Fond du Lac wherein the Anishinaabeg demanded a voluntary school be established at the Sault. The creation of the school and mission complex at the Sault led to a great need for mission assistants and teachers. As such, Rev. Bingham hired Mary Rice in 1830 to serve both as a domestic and instructress at the infant school. Like other employees of the mission, Rice set out to learn the Anishinaabeg language. During her employment at the mission from 1830 to 1834, Rice met and worked alongside Charlotte, Jane, and Eliza Johnston. Her friendships with the Johnston sisters would have allowed her to meet George Johnston when he was in the Sault.\u00a0 Stress, working conditions, and general ill health in the Sault region, caused Rice to become regularly ill by 1834, most often with a lung complaint. Bingham, concerned that Rice had contracted consumption, decided that she should work in a climate more suited to her condition.", "Interestingly, the more \u201csuitable climate\u201d chosen was in Georgia, which was also considered damp, changeable, and prone to consumption. Thus, I am left wondering if the transfer of Rice from one station to the next was a mask for something else.\u00a0 While it cannot be confirmed, George Johnston\u2019s first wife, Louisa Raymond Johnston, had died in 1832 leaving George in charge of three children, born in 1823, 1825, and 1827.\u00a0 Records indicate that George had a romantic interest that his family disapproved of in the early 1830s, around the time of his wife\u2019s death.\u00a0By 1832-1834, Bingham had a falling out with the Johnston family and sisters, which led to their withdrawal from the Baptist Church and eventual allegiance with the Methodists, Presbyterians, and Anglicans. Such a schism would have led to the withdrawal of friendships between the Johnstons and various Baptist mission employees and other supporters of Rev. Bingham. Perhaps Rice\u2019s transfer had more to do with a possible romance with George Johnston than a concern for consumption. Unfortunately, the records remain silent on the issue.", "Corresponding with\u00a0 Dr. Bolles of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (ABFMS) in December 1834, Rice requested a transfer from the Western Creek Mission station based on her continued ill health. Her letter indicates a great desire to leave as well as hope that she would continue to be useful to the ABFMS somewhere in a more accommodating eastern climate. The records unfortunately fail to indicate whether or not Rice maintained contact with the Johnston family.\u00a0Most likely she did not correspond with them based on the controversies of the early 1830s. Rice, however, appears to have maintained a correspondence with Bingham. The ABFMS returned Rice to the Sault in 1836 as an assistant in the school and mission house.", "At this point in 1836, George Johnston had once again become a resident of the Sault. He continued to work as an occasional interpreter and guide for Bingham, as well as other missionaries, Indian agents, and tourists in the area. Notwithstanding a lack of solid evidence for an earlier romance with George or continued correspondence with the Johnston sisters, Rice immediately renewed old friendships upon returning. Again, the records cannot tell us the details of Rice\u2019s and Johnston's courtship, although it does appear that Bingham disapproved of the intimate association between Rice and Johnston. This disapproval is what likely led to the couple slipping away from the Sault mission and travelling to Mackinaw Island where they were wed on July 16, 1839. Upon discovering that Rice had wed Johnston, Bingham wrote the ABFMS board expressing his disapproval and requesting direction. Prior to drafting the letter, however, Bingham had already dismissed Rice from her position and suspended her church membership. He likewise terminated George Johnston. Despite Bingham's disapproval and dire predictions for the match, Rice and Johnston were hired by the Michigan Superintendency of Indian Affairs, which their brother-in-law, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, ran, to work at Grand Traverse as interpreters and model farmers. Rice was hired as an interpreter at a $300 per annum salary, which was in addition to Johnston\u2019s salary. After being dismissed from their posts apparently the (U.S. government objected to the apparent nepotistic hiring), George and Mary Johnston operated a trading establishment. The couple had four children: Benjamin Saurin (b.1840), James Laurence Kearney (b.1842), Samuel Abbott (b.1844), and Eliza Ann Jane (b.1846), who was named after George\u2019s three sisters. The three boys died in the U.S. Civil War, while Eliza lived into her 70s.", "Eventually the couple returned to the Sault in October 1846 and by 1849-1850 the couple opened a boarding house thereby taking advantage of the Sault\u2019s increasing stature as a tourist destination. William Benjamin Robinson stayed at the Johnston\u2019s boarding house while negotiating the Robinson-Huron and Robinson-Superior Treaties in 1850.\u00a0 By 1855, after the intercession of a friend, the couple rented the now empty Baptist mission buildings, which they renovated into a hotel/boarding house. The couple ran the boarding house until Mary\u2019s death in 1858. Thereafter, George was forced to remove from the old mission house, apparently for failing to pay rent for several years,\u00a0 and occupy empty barracks in U.S. Fort Brady with his young family.\u00a0Eliza, 12 at the time of her mother\u2019s death, was sent to live with Mary Rice Johnston\u2019s sister Hannah in 1858. She returned to the Sault in 1860 only to leave again after her father\u2019s death.", "Seemingly bereft after his wife\u2019s death, George increasingly corresponded with various individuals seeking indemnities for his involvement in the War of 1812, the destruction of his father\u2019s property in 1814, as well as various other claims and speculations. George died while on a walk one winter morning on Jan. 6, 1861 near the Sault canal by the rapids. Thus ended the story of a romance and elopement that shook the Sault in 1839.", "Karl S.

Let\u2019s stop ignoring the elephant in the room in the name of political correctness! It\u2019s time to admit that many aspects of such world views are a hindrance to human progress and harmony in the 21st century.", "When one thinks that these horrific murders were done in retaliation to \u201ccaricatures\u201d of the Prophet Muhammad, it is sad to see that there is actually little justification for such crimes in the Qur\u2019an, apart from the command against idolatry. But when it comes to religious ideologies, people like to pick and choose from their holy books what fits their own needs and justifies their ways of living. Muslims fighting each other in the Middle East all claim to act in the name of \u201ctrue\u201d Islam, even though they belong to competing factions of the tradition. What we see are simply various facets of a religion. It is strange how people say that the Paris attacks do not reflect \u201ctrue\u201d Islam, but rarely think the same thing about attacks far from home.", "On the issue of homeland security, Prime Minister Harper recently announced new policies against possible terror attacks, but Quebec Premier Couillard has been quite sheepish with the entire issue. He seems to believe that fundamentalism is a personal choice which has nothing to do with Islam. But will new security measures protect our country from terrorism? Another noteworthy approach would be to wage war against the ideology that feeds violent actions. Here is where education comes into play. How? Potential radicals first need to be informed of the costs of radicalization. For example, many are unaware that ISIS recently executed 200 fighters who had joined their ranks but wanted to return home after being disillusioned with the whole enterprise. People become radicalized because they experience some sense of personal or collective injustice, while others are simply seeking meaning in their lives. Being vulnerable to radical religious ideologies can lead to a destructive path.", "As a secular society, we have to denounce radicalization. The way to go about this is through a counter-ideology, one that helps people to create their own meaningful life and sense of worth, in line with humanistic and liberal values. Fighting terrorism also means promoting better ideas than those who seek to extinguish freedom and life.", "But modern secular societies also have a responsibility to adopt and uphold a critical perspective toward all oppressive religious ideologies and political systems. Humanistic values should be at the core of pluralistic societies, and ideas that promote violence should be resisted. This is why Islam, or any other religious tradition that stifles human dignity, should be critiqued. Strangely enough, people have little problem with critically assessing the value of political decisions, scientific discoveries, artistic expression, or other aspects of culture. But religion \u2014 and these days, the Islamic tradition \u2014 seems off limits. Muslims can disagree with the assessment people make of their tradition, but the best way to state their case is with ink and paper. People who choose otherwise confirm their lack of valid arguments in the face of reasonable objections. They simply shut out competing world views and suppress freedom of thought and expression by violently silencing those who oppose their ideology.", "With all this being said, religion cannot be blamed for every violent action in the world; there are other factors at work. But secular societies clearly need to position themselves regarding sacred texts and the religions that uphold them.", "Andr\u00e9 Gagn\u00e9 is an associate professor in the departments of religion and theology at Concordia University.", "The Story So Far: Jordan executes two after pilot killed by...", "Opinion: Holocaust education is crucial, but it cannot happen in a...", "Comments", "We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Long hours dedicated to reading, attending classes and completing work leave little time for student parents to balance studying and caring for their children.", "Additionally, the cost of sending a child to a Quebec daycare facility is something that not all student parents can afford. For those who don\u2019t qualify for government-subsidized childcare, daycare programs can cost more than $30 per day. With the current Quebec Liberal government\u2019s austerity measures cutting funding to public institutions\u2014such as daycare facilities\u2014the situation for student parents is only becoming more bleak.", "Quebec\u2019s daycare program, which guarantees a $7-a-day province-run childcare service for Quebec residents, was initiated in 1997 to help low-income families strike a balance between working and raising children. That very institution is now likely to be changed to a system that runs on a sliding scale based on family income, despite the Liberal government\u2019s promise in the 2014 election campaign to index daycare fees to inflation. The benefits of a free childcare service for university students are clear, even if most students don\u2019t earn enough to see the sort of drastic rise in daycare rates proposed by the Liberals for high-income earners.", "In November, we supported the referendum question mandating continued research into the possibility of opening a", "CSU", "-run, on-campus daycare. A recent report published by the", "CSU", "details the projected costs of establishing the facility, suggesting that the total bill could run as high as $1.1 million, although anticipated government subsidies could amount to almost $300,000. The costs admittedly aren\u2019t cheap, but we believe the service and the opportunities it will provide are priceless.", "We also support the CSU\u2019s recommendation that the union spend additional money equipping the daycare to accept children under the age of 18 months. Concordia has two existing childcare centres, but only one of them currently accepts infants, and the waiting list for this facility is two years long.", "Most of Concordia\u2019s existing daycare spots are filled by the children of faculty and staff members, leaving student parents with few in-house options for care.

Men who presided over the decline (and did not pay bankers for a year or more) do not deserve a second chance. This is the new rule of the game for insolvent companies looking for buyers who could turn them around.", "It's a politically powerful signal. It's a blunt and unforgiving message. And it makes sharp headlines even if it doesn't necessarily make great business sense for banks who have to salvage sunk loans by selling an insolvent company -- preferably to a buyer who is willing to pay the most.", "Banks, which are often -- and sometimes unfairly -- blamed for years of loose lending and their nexus with business houses, were probably not even consulted in deciding the terms of the Ordinance. Having lost the credibility that financial institutions once enjoyed, they are now left with little discretion. All they can do is obey inflexible rules that the government sets for them.", "There are companies and assets which would only attract the promoters or founders due to the nature of the business, complications, and legacy; these promoters may even be willing to fork out premium to get back on the board of directors.", "Before the Ordinance, most bankers would have been willing to cut a deal and accept a haircut on loans as long as such promoters were not perceived as corrupt or categorised as `wilful defaulters'; in other words, as long as there was no evidence or forensic audit show they had diverted funds to other group companies or personal accounts, or the company they ran had failed to service loan despite posting operating profits.", "Today, they can't - thanks to the Ordinance that makes it virtually impossible for banks to deal with most of the original promoters.", "Even though Indian banks have not exactly displayed great lending acumen, they should have been given the discretion (in choosing promoters who are not swindlers), simply to pave the way for quicker resolutions and help the Bankruptcy Code take off. The Ordinance should have simultaneously given bankers the freedom and protection to reject a top dollar bid from a promoter who may not figure in the list of `wilful defaulters' but is nonetheless dodgy and do not enjoy a great reputation.", "But banks, it seems, have lost the trust that could have let them retain that choice. (However, the flip side to the Ordinance is that it spares some bankers the ethical and financial dilemma while evaluating a bid from old, familiar clients.)", "By shutting the doors to promoters of all hues, and by somewhat doing away with the difference between wilful and ordinary defaulter, banks would for first time treat an individual and corporate on a par.", "How?", "If a person loses her job - irrespective of whether the employer is hit by Chinese dumping, or she is found incompetent - lenders are quick to react. The borrower has to beg, borrow and starve to cough up EMIs to avert a foreclosure and save her family the trauma of homelessness.

Limited awareness about the condition in the late \u201990s only made things worse. \u201cSo we had to learn with him,\u201d says the former high court lawyer who now works with her son at a paper bag unit founded by her.", "Grappling with social situations", "Dambal recalls how, as a young boy, Anmol used to get into fights with children from the neighbourhood and get agitated around his younger brother. \u201cIt used to upset me no end,\u201d she says. Twelve-year-old Ayan Dogra\u2019s mother Shweta even considered giving up public outings. Shweta remembers that her son would settle down on the floor and start yelling and tear up thermocol. Both mothers, however, decided that avoiding public spaces and situations was not a solution. \u201cI realised that as soon as I explained the situation to people, they were understanding,\u201d Dambal says, while Dogra decided to not try to control her son and also became more vocal about his condition. \u201cWe\u2019ve never hidden the fact that he\u2019s autistic,\u201d says the former publicist-turnedhomemaker.

While Bhambhani had the support of her husband, parents and daughter in raising their son, who is now an artist and a foodie, she feels that \u201cthose who aren\u2019t empathetic [to her son\u2019s condition], aren\u2019t worth it\u201d.

From being a cloistered person who \u201cwouldn\u2019t even go down to the market to buy groceries alone\u201d, Bhambhani learnt to ride a scooter to accompany her son Ayush to therapy, school and everywhere in between. Ferose recalls how he was a rising young star, becoming one of the youngest chief executives in India at the age of 33, a post he held for over five years. \u201cJuggling work, travel, doctor visits, therapies and the desire to lead a normal life was overwhelming,\u201d he says. His wife, who worked part time for a couple of years when Vivaan was younger, has since been a stay-at-home mom to care for Vivaan, which Ferose feels \u201cis more than a full time job\u201d. \u201cI think going to work is like taking a vacation compared to staying home to take care of home and family. We all have our own coping mechanisms. My wife copes by throwing herself completely into bringing up Vivaan,\u201d he says.", "Their social life is constrained, despite their best effort. Going for dinner or movies can be challenging. \u201cHaving friends who understand the condition and are flexible makes it easier. The numerous therapies and doctor visits get taxing. But it is the slow pace of progress that tires you. Taking a regular break to unwind is mandatory for our sanity,\u201d says Ferose, who loves reading and writing. A pursuit that was triggered by Vivaan\u2019s condition was curating the India Inclusion Summit, an egalitarian platform, which brings together global thought leaders working in the field of inclusion to deliberate, discuss and take forward different talents available in the society. He also co-authored Gifted, a book of inspiring stories of those with disabilities. Four years ago, the family moved to California so that Vivaan attend a regular school.", "Bhambhani has often ignored stares and whispers as Ayush lay prostrate in the middle of a shopping mall, throwing a tantrum. She\u2019s also pulled him out of schools that claimed to be inclusive and integrated, but locked him up in a room. She taught him the difference between night and day by taking him for a walk in the middle of the night to physically show him that establishments are shut and that he can\u2019t go shopping or watch a movie at that time. She has endured 20-minute-long teeth brushing rituals, while he learns to do it on his own. It has meant changing their lifestyle to always ensure that one parent is at home no matter what. But importantly, she has also ensured that her younger daughter doesn\u2019t feel neglected because of the extra attention that Ayush demands.", "Seeking help", "The first and most important support system has to be the family and Bhambhani\u2019s parents have been open-minded, involved and accepting of Ayush\u2019s situation. But to be able to care and comfort correctly, counselling is imperative. Sarbani Mallick, founder-director and managing trustee, Bubbles Centre for Autism and Pragati Vocational Skill Centre, says mothers confide in her that they cannot even get a minute off for themselves \u2014 sometimes not even being able to afford the privacy for a change during their period. \u201cThey are so worried about what the child will do in their absence; they have no peace of mind. A few days ago, I came across a mother who wanted to kill her child. The other parents we counsel are mostly in denial and come to us two years post-diagnosis at the earliest.\u201d Mallick also makes home visits, which helps her assess the situation for both child and parent. \u201cThe problem is complex. Many children appear fine physically, so it becomes harder for parents to accept that their child has a problem. And then, there\u2019s the blame game at home to figure out what went wrong. For many parents, life comes to a halt. And going for counselling only reaffirms that their child has a problem. So, they hesitate asking for help.\u201d", "But quality intervention can change lives. How else would", "Unabashedly Ayush", ", a book chronicling Ayush\u2019s journey, woven through his artworks, put together by creative agency Pink Lemonade, have been possible? Ayush\u2019s transition from someone who couldn\u2019t brush his teeth or tie his laces, to a boy who is independent and can command art shows with the sheer velocity of his work, is an inspiring story. But none of it would have been possible without the support and perseverance of his mother, something even Tina Garg, Founder & CEO of Pink Lemonade acknowledges. Like the proverbial woman in every successful man\u2019s life, Bhambhani, supported by her family and the staff at Sense Kaleidoscopes (Ayathi Trust), which works with autistic children, has been the force behind Ayush\u2019s growth. Encouraged by his teachers at Ayathi Trust, she put together the book on his journey \u201cto chronicle his artistic streak as well as build awareness about the condition,\u201d Garg says.

At the centre of the production is Brian Houghton Hodgson, a British naturalist based in India and Nepal in 1837, a character that has inspired its scriptwriter and director, Dr John Mathew, who currently teaches at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (IISER), Pune. \u201cHe\u2019s fascinating,\u201d says Mathew of Hodgson, \u201cThe chap knew Nepali, Newari, Tibetan. He studied Tibetan architecture, ethnography and wrote some 100 papers on Indian birds and mammals. All the while, he was involved in palace intrigue.\u201d When we watch Hodgson on stage during a rehearsal, it\u2019s his voice that makes heads turn. Sandip Varkey George, a PhD student from the physics department, is researching chaos theory when he isn\u2019t working his impressive baritone on stage. \u201cNewbies are rather well encouraged to join theatre here,\u201d says George, who adds that he was intimidated by the theatre scene during his undergrad days at Delhi University, \u201cThis is my first major show at IISER. I barely made the cut during my first audition, but my second audition went well.\u201d", "Since early this year, over 70 students at IISER, Pune, comprising cast or crew have been working on", "The Sun Was White; The Moon Disobedient", ",", "and describe it as the most ambitious project that they have taken up at the institute. \u201cI\u2019ve never done theatre before, but last semester, John had a course on \u2018Science, History and Theatre\u2019, which was my introduction to theatre. What surprised me about this production was the scale of it and the talent that we have here at IISER,\u201d says production director, Shraddha Lall, who is a student of the BSMS (Biology) programme at the institute. That Hodgson creates the axis around which both the present and the past revolve, is the most interesting aspect for Lall, who has studied evolutionary biology and has closely followed Hodgson\u2019s work. \u201cHow Hodgson transcends through time, the parallels that we see in politics and how Hodgson and Manjushree relate to each other across centuries shows how history can be important in ways that you cannot imagine,\u201d adds Lall. Mathew, who has a PhD from Harvard University on the history of science that focused on late eighteenth to early twentieth century naturalists in India, has been researching the subject for a few years now. \u201cHodgson is a complicated character,\u201d says Mathew, \u201cHe takes up with this aristocratic Kashmiri woman or a dhobini (named Meharunnisha in the play). I\u2019ve gone with the dhobini story because it just made it more interesting for me. Amritananda, a priest of the Vajracharyas, which is a non-celibate group of monks, helped him with Buddhist texts and was rumoured to have had an affair with Meharunnisha before he introduced him to Hodgson. But I draw attention to that situation in a song-out if you will.\u201d", "All original songs in the musical, which also features standards such as \u201cI\u2019m Beginning To See The Light\u201d by jazz legend, Ella Fitzgerald, have been composed by Mathew. \u201cI really want us to do musicals,\u201d he says, \u201cAndrew Lloyd Weber\u2019s", "Jesus Christ Superstar", "keeps getting done.

It\u2019s usually me and one more musician creating music that is used in the background,\u201d says 26-year-old Sekhar, a PhD student of astrophysics, \u201cBut here, we\u2019re accompanying the singers, so it\u2019s like a supporting role for us.\u201d While Sekhar is in charge of a seven-member band of musicians, the ensemble backing the cast also includes an 11-member choir. \u201cWe are doing a lot of harmonies because that\u2019s the one thing that audiences are not used to in India and we\u2019ve worked on about 20 songs,\u201d says Abhinaya V, another PhD student and the vocal director for", "The Sun Was White; The Moon Disobedient", ".", "The musical also includes a popular Nepali folk song titled \u201cResamm Firiri\u201d, except that it has been transformed into a blues song.", "Mathew, who has spent close to nine years on bringing", "The Sun Was White; The Moon Disobedient", "to life, spares no effort in recreating the socio-political landscape in Nepal down to the last detail.

For a production that is a debut musical for most of the cast and crew, the ambition is Himalayan-sized. \u201cIf we fail, we\u2019ll ensure we fail spectacularly,\u201d says Mathew.", "The Sun Was White; The Moon Disobedient", "will be staged on October 27 at 8 pm and October 28 at 12 pm at the CV Raman Auditorium at IISER, Pune", "\u2588 I really want us to do musicals.

Using a \u2018scrub\u2019 may lead to micro abrasions, that may cause a micro inflammation, which will in turn lead to pigmentation.\u201d She explains that some exfoliation products and oldfashioned scrubs with large, granules are what ought to be avoided, \u201cbut exfoliation itself isn\u2019t bad for you. Ideally, it should be done in the night time, as the process removes dead skin, leaving your skin most receptive to damage, and it\u2019s best not to expose it to the elements (like sunlight) in that state. Use a nourishing cream after a gentle exfoliator at night time for maximum benefit.\u201d", "Instead:", "\u201cUse a gentle face wash which comes with exfoliating beads in it, and ensure it\u2019s manufactured by a reputed company. For a natural alternative, use a blend of sugar and honey,\u201d says Dr Shetty. She adds that one should limit exfoliation to once a week, \u201cunless very sure about how gentle the product you\u2019re using is on the skin.\u201d", "SKIN LIGHTENING CREAMS", "Here\u2019s why:", "\u201cI would never use skin lightening creams which contain cortisone and hydroquinone,\u201d says Dr Jaishree Sharad, CEO, Skinfiniti Aesthetic and Laser Clinic, referring to applications which are sometimes used to treat age spots and skin discolouration, \u201cas these could have harmful effects.\u201d She explains, \u201cThey make the skin thin, sensitive and sometimes you may have rebound pigmentation or acne breakouts. \u201cSkin lightening products with fluocinolone or mometasone are particularly harmful,\u201d adds Dr Sharad.", "Instead:", "\u201cYou may use Vitamin C serums, curcumin or turmeric-based creams or creams containing arbutin and liquorice,\u201d she says.", "POPPING ZITS", "Here\u2019s why:", "\u201cWhen one pops a pimple, there is damage to the skin which leads to hyperpigmentation (darkening) and the likelihood of scarring. Many apply toothpaste, garlic or neem on pimples, believing that these would reduce the inflammation, but in some cases using such items may lead to skin irritation and inflammation. They may even cause a superficial burn,\u201d says dermatologist Dr Zubin Mandlewala of Reflectionz Clinic.", "Instead:", "\u201cConsult a doctor, so he or she may assess the root cause of the acne. This could be hormonal, caused by some cosmetics or because of the consumption of high glycaemic foods, or one\u2019s occupation and lifestyle may even be what\u2019s at the root of the problem,\u201d says Dr Mandlewala. Acne can be of two types: noninflammatory (white heads and black heads) and inflammatory (red and/or pus-filled pimples). \u201cDepending on the type, it must be treated with topical creams, gels, oral medications, and, if necessary, certain procedures,\u201d says Dr Mandlewala.", "OTC FUNGAL INFECTION CREAMS", "Here\u2019s why:", "Dermatologist Dr Gayatri Bharadwaj explains, \u201cFungal infections typically manifest as an itchy rash, generally in the folds of the skin. Most people are not aware of the dangers of using OTC creams to treat these and are desperate for instant relief. But, many such products contain steroids that damage the skin and/ or cause thinning of the skin, redness, acne, scars and stretch marks. Besides, superficial blood vessels become visible with prolonged use of these. And, furthermore, long-term use may cause serious side-effects like kidney damage, growth retardation in children, bone loss, swelling of the body, diabetes, depression, psychosis and memory loss,\u201d she says. And, for all that, these don\u2019t even cure fungal infections; the problem will resurface as soon as the treatment is discontinued.", "Instead:", "\u201cOpt for proper antifungal creams or oral medication, which should be prescribed by a qualified dermatologist. And, preventive measures help, for example, keep the affected area totally dry and wear loose cotton clothes as sweating worsens this condition,\u201d says Dr Bharadwaj.", "WAXING FACIAL HAIR", "Here\u2019s why:", "\u201cWaxing the face can damage the epidermis and may cause hair follicles to get infected (folliculitis). Also, repeated waxing can cause the skin to turn dark,\u201d says skin specialist Dr Rasya Dixit.", "Instead:", "\u201cThough expensive, laser hair removal is a good alternative, as the laser only affects the hair and doesn\u2019t damage the skin,\u201d she says.", "HAIR-REMOVAL TECHNIQUES FOR GIRLS", "Here\u2019s why:", "Many girls under the age of 10 years complain of excessive hair growth these days. \u201cHowever, laser hair removal treatments or any other hair removal techniques are pointless at this time. For one thing, the skin is too delicate. Besides, post puberty there will be a change in the hair cycle, so even if the girl has gone through a laser treatment, the hair will grow back. Besides, if the child has any hormonal imbalance, the hair may grow back thicker,\u201d warns Dr Krupa Amonkar, consulting dermatologist, Palkar\u2019s Polyclinic.", "Instead:", "If your daughter is adamant about having hair removal treatments, \u201cyou may reduce the frequency of these by using solutions to reduce hair growth, such as eflonithin creams. These prolong the hair cycle, i.e. the hair takes longer to grow back,\u201d says Dr Amonkar.", "ANTI-AGEING CREAMS", "Here\u2019s why:", "Ageing skin is the result of multiple factors \u2014 constant, cumulative sun exposure, an erratic lifestyle and genetics are some of these. Due to these, collagen and elastin get depleted from the deeper layers of skin and this causes signs of ageing like wrinkles, open pores and coarse, rough skin. \u201cThe idea that a topical anti-ageing cream will correct these issues that arise due to problems that run far deeper, has no basis in logic,\u201d says Dr Madhuri Agarwal, founder and medical director of Yavana Aesthetics Clinic.", "Instead:", "\u201cIdeally, to keep your skin looking young and supple for longer, it is advised to start a healthy skin care regimen from the age of 25,\u201d says Dr Agarwal. \u201cAlso, consume a balanced diet, loaded with antioxidants, proteins and micronutrients as these help repair the internal environment, which cause signs of ageing. Antioxidants also reduce the damage caused by stress and pollutants etc. Sun exposure is the main reason that Indians age so rapidly, so use sunscreens, even when indoors.\u201d Additionally, she recommends using serums with Vitamin C and retinol for normal to oily skin, and \u201cIf you have dry skin, use moisturisers with these plus hyaluronic acid as these ingredients hydrate and prevent ageing. Also, consume at least two to three litres of water daily, as dry skin looks older.\u201d Dr Agarwal adds, \u201cOnce your skin starts to look aged, reversing the damage may require a combination of medical products or cosmeceuticals and aesthetic treatments involving lasers, radiofrequency, botox, dermal fillers and threadlift. We even use these to keep the signs of ageing at bay nowadays.\u201d", "\u2588 When one pops a pimple, the action damages the skin, leading to hyperpigmentation (darkening) and it may even leave a scar", "\u2014 Dr Zubin Mandlewala", "\u2588 Waxing the hair on the face can cause damage to the epidermis or upper layer of skin, and may cause hair follicles to get infected (folliculitis)", "\u2014

Parents of children with developmental disorders on how one copes", "Nine-year-old Vivaan\u2019s first word was iPad. A child\u2019s first word is always special for a parent, but for VR Ferose and wife Deepali Kulkarni, it was more than just that. Diagnosed with autism when he was 18 months old, Vivaan is mostly non-verbal. So \u2018iPad\u2019 merited \u2014 like Vivaan\u2019s other milestones: first day in school, first school performance, first birthday \u2014 a small celebration. As parents of a child with special needs, Ferose (a senior VP with a global IT firm) and his wife have gone through denial, depression, pain before arriving at acceptance and joy. But it has been an arduous journey \u2014 like it is for all those parenting children with special needs. Dealing with the news that one\u2019s child is born with a neurodevelopmental disorder can be challenging for any parent.", "For Kavita Dambal, mother to 19-year-old Anmol (who was initially misdiagnosed with ADHD and later diagnosed with autism at age four-and-a-half), the shock was so severe that she went into depression. \u201cI stopped eating for a couple of months,\u201d she says, admitting that she was resentful and unable to come to terms with reality. Limited awareness about the condition in the late \u201990s only made things worse. \u201cSo we had to learn with him,\u201d says the former high court lawyer who now works with her son at a paper bag unit founded by her.", "Grappling with social situations", "Dambal recalls how, as a young boy, Anmol used to get into fights with children from the neighbourhood and get agitated around his younger brother. \u201cIt used to upset me no end,\u201d she says. Twelve-year-old Ayan Dogra\u2019s mother Shweta even considered giving up public outings. Shweta remembers that her son would settle down on the floor and start yelling and tear up thermocol. Both mothers, however, decided that avoiding public spaces and situations was not a solution. \u201cI realised that as soon as I explained the situation to people, they were understanding,\u201d Dambal says, while Dogra decided to not try to control her son and also became more vocal about his condition. \u201cWe\u2019ve never hidden the fact that he\u2019s autistic,\u201d says the former publicist-turnedhomemaker. Sometimes, she tells visitors to postpone their visits because Ayan is going through a \u201crough phase\u201d. \u201cSometimes, he\u2019s not in a good mood and doesn\u2019t like anyone coming home. He\u2019s also going through hormonal changes. So why torture him with things he\u2019s not comfortable with?\u201d", "Preeti Bhambhani, whose 19-year-old son Ayush was diagnosed with the condition at age two, agrees that parents need to be more accepting and less controlling. While Bhambhani had the support of her husband, parents and daughter in raising their son, who is now an artist and a foodie, she feels that \u201cthose who aren\u2019t empathetic [to her son\u2019s condition], aren\u2019t worth it\u201d. Bhambhani lost friends and relatives because \u201cthey were insensitive to his condition\u201d, and doesn\u2019t regret it.", "Life alterations", "Parenting a child with special needs necessitates a lifestyle overhaul. From being a cloistered person who \u201cwouldn\u2019t even go down to the market to buy groceries alone\u201d, Bhambhani learnt to ride a scooter to accompany her son Ayush to therapy, school and everywhere in between. Ferose recalls how he was a rising young star, becoming one of the youngest chief executives in India at the age of 33, a post he held for over five years. \u201cJuggling work, travel, doctor visits, therapies and the desire to lead a normal life was overwhelming,\u201d he says. His wife, who worked part time for a couple of years when Vivaan was younger, has since been a stay-at-home mom to care for Vivaan, which Ferose feels \u201cis more than a full time job\u201d. \u201cI think going to work is like taking a vacation compared to staying home to take care of home and family. We all have our own coping mechanisms. My wife copes by throwing herself completely into bringing up Vivaan,\u201d he says.", "Their social life is constrained, despite their best effort. Going for dinner or movies can be challenging. \u201cHaving friends who understand the condition and are flexible makes it easier. The numerous therapies and doctor visits get taxing. But it is the slow pace of progress that tires you. Taking a regular break to unwind is mandatory for our sanity,\u201d says Ferose, who loves reading and writing. A pursuit that was triggered by Vivaan\u2019s condition was curating the India Inclusion Summit, an egalitarian platform, which brings together global thought leaders working in the field of inclusion to deliberate, discuss and take forward different talents available in the society. He also co-authored Gifted, a book of inspiring stories of those with disabilities. Four years ago, the family moved to California so that Vivaan attend a regular school.", "Bhambhani has often ignored stares and whispers as Ayush lay prostrate in the middle of a shopping mall, throwing a tantrum. She\u2019s also pulled him out of schools that claimed to be inclusive and integrated, but locked him up in a room. She taught him the difference between night and day by taking him for a walk in the middle of the night to physically show him that establishments are shut and that he can\u2019t go shopping or watch a movie at that time. She has endured 20-minute-long teeth brushing rituals, while he learns to do it on his own. It has meant changing their lifestyle to always ensure that one parent is at home no matter what. But importantly, she has also ensured that her younger daughter doesn\u2019t feel neglected because of the extra attention that Ayush demands.", "Seeking help", "The first and most important support system has to be the family and Bhambhani\u2019s parents have been open-minded, involved and accepting of Ayush\u2019s situation. But to be able to care and comfort correctly, counselling is imperative. Sarbani Mallick, founder-director and managing trustee, Bubbles Centre for Autism and Pragati Vocational Skill Centre, says mothers confide in her that they cannot even get a minute off for themselves \u2014 sometimes not even being able to afford the privacy for a change during their period. \u201cThey are so worried about what the child will do in their absence; they have no peace of mind. A few days ago, I came across a mother who wanted to kill her child. The other parents we counsel are mostly in denial and come to us two years post-diagnosis at the earliest.\u201d Mallick also makes home visits, which helps her assess the situation for both child and parent. \u201cThe problem is complex. Many children appear fine physically, so it becomes harder for parents to accept that their child has a problem. And then, there\u2019s the blame game at home to figure out what went wrong. For many parents, life comes to a halt. And going for counselling only reaffirms that their child has a problem. So, they hesitate asking for help.\u201d", "But quality intervention can change lives. How else would", "Unabashedly Ayush", ", a book chronicling Ayush\u2019s journey, woven through his artworks, put together by creative agency Pink Lemonade, have been possible? Ayush\u2019s transition from someone who couldn\u2019t brush his teeth or tie his laces, to a boy who is independent and can command art shows with the sheer velocity of his work, is an inspiring story. But none of it would have been possible without the support and perseverance of his mother, something even Tina Garg, Founder & CEO of Pink Lemonade acknowledges. Like the proverbial woman in every successful man\u2019s life, Bhambhani, supported by her family and the staff at Sense Kaleidoscopes (Ayathi Trust), which works with autistic children, has been the force behind Ayush\u2019s growth. Encouraged by his teachers at Ayathi Trust, she put together the book on his journey \u201cto chronicle his artistic streak as well as build awareness about the condition,\u201d Garg says. The coffee table book is packed with vivid drawings, interactive pop-up elements such as magnets, shoes that can have laces tied through them, foldable pages and shapes and much more. All in a bid to showcase the incredible depth and breadth of Ayush\u2019s thought process, and his willingness to live life by his own rules.", "Learning to cope", "There are rewards too. Not comparing Vivaan to other kids has been his parents\u2019 key to happiness. \u201cVivaan will turn nine years old soon and he is our life. As our only child, he is normal to us even if he is labelled as a child with autism. Our coping mechanism has been to treat him like every other child and we are still learning every day. Being mostly non-verbal, he remains a mystery to us. We are always trying to guess what\u2019s going on in his mind. Even now, he surprises us every day \u2014 he knows a lot more than what we think he knows. He is a happy child and has spread a lot of happiness around him,\u201d Ferose says. \u201cAnd he is the favourite of all his teachers.\u201d", "Today, Bhambhani believes", "Unabashedly Ayush", "will be an invaluable tool for parents and persons working with autistic children. The litmus test is that it has been loved by Ayush. How do we know that? Because when she showed him the book, he gave her a spontaneous kiss and a hug, the instances of which she can \u201ccount on fingers\u201d.

At the centre of the production is Brian Houghton Hodgson, a British naturalist based in India and Nepal in 1837, a character that has inspired its scriptwriter and director, Dr John Mathew, who currently teaches at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (IISER), Pune. \u201cHe\u2019s fascinating,\u201d says Mathew of Hodgson, \u201cThe chap knew Nepali, Newari, Tibetan. He studied Tibetan architecture, ethnography and wrote some 100 papers on Indian birds and mammals. All the while, he was involved in palace intrigue.\u201d When we watch Hodgson on stage during a rehearsal, it\u2019s his voice that makes heads turn. Sandip Varkey George, a PhD student from the physics department, is researching chaos theory when he isn\u2019t working his impressive baritone on stage. \u201cNewbies are rather well encouraged to join theatre here,\u201d says George, who adds that he was intimidated by the theatre scene during his undergrad days at Delhi University, \u201cThis is my first major show at IISER.

What surprised me about this production was the scale of it and the talent that we have here at IISER,\u201d says production director, Shraddha Lall, who is a student of the BSMS (Biology) programme at the institute. That Hodgson creates the axis around which both the present and the past revolve, is the most interesting aspect for Lall, who has studied evolutionary biology and has closely followed Hodgson\u2019s work. \u201cHow Hodgson transcends through time, the parallels that we see in politics and how Hodgson and Manjushree relate to each other across centuries shows how history can be important in ways that you cannot imagine,\u201d adds Lall. Mathew, who has a PhD from Harvard University on the history of science that focused on late eighteenth to early twentieth century naturalists in India, has been researching the subject for a few years now. \u201cHodgson is a complicated character,\u201d says Mathew, \u201cHe takes up with this aristocratic Kashmiri woman or a dhobini (named Meharunnisha in the play). I\u2019ve gone with the dhobini story because it just made it more interesting for me. Amritananda, a priest of the Vajracharyas, which is a non-celibate group of monks, helped him with Buddhist texts and was rumoured to have had an affair with Meharunnisha before he introduced him to Hodgson.

You know there\u2019s only one pro who actually knows the secret to good skin: the dermatologist. She or he has studied the subject for years, and you can bet that she or he would have tried and tested all sorts of treatments, whether these have to do with skin, hair or nails. So, when dermatologists stay away from a product or process, you know you\u2019d be wise to do so too. Here\u2019s a list of what to avoid:", "EXFOLIATING SCRUBS", "Here\u2019s why:", "Dr Rashmi Shetty, aesthetic dermatologist, Ra Skin and Aesthetics, explains, \u201cThe skin is soft and delicate, hence should be treated carefully. Using a \u2018scrub\u2019 may lead to micro abrasions, that may cause a micro inflammation, which will in turn lead to pigmentation.\u201d She explains that some exfoliation products and oldfashioned scrubs with large, granules are what ought to be avoided, \u201cbut exfoliation itself isn\u2019t bad for you. Ideally, it should be done in the night time, as the process removes dead skin, leaving your skin most receptive to damage, and it\u2019s best not to expose it to the elements (like sunlight) in that state. Use a nourishing cream after a gentle exfoliator at night time for maximum benefit.\u201d", "Instead:", "\u201cUse a gentle face wash which comes with exfoliating beads in it, and ensure it\u2019s manufactured by a reputed company. For a natural alternative, use a blend of sugar and honey,\u201d says Dr Shetty. She adds that one should limit exfoliation to once a week, \u201cunless very sure about how gentle the product you\u2019re using is on the skin.\u201d", "SKIN LIGHTENING CREAMS", "Here\u2019s why:", "\u201cI would never use skin lightening creams which contain cortisone and hydroquinone,\u201d says Dr Jaishree Sharad, CEO, Skinfiniti Aesthetic and Laser Clinic, referring to applications which are sometimes used to treat age spots and skin discolouration, \u201cas these could have harmful effects.\u201d She explains, \u201cThey make the skin thin, sensitive and sometimes you may have rebound pigmentation or acne breakouts. \u201cSkin lightening products with fluocinolone or mometasone are particularly harmful,\u201d adds Dr Sharad.", "Instead:", "\u201cYou may use Vitamin C serums, curcumin or turmeric-based creams or creams containing arbutin and liquorice,\u201d she says.", "POPPING ZITS", "Here\u2019s why:", "\u201cWhen one pops a pimple, there is damage to the skin which leads to hyperpigmentation (darkening) and the likelihood of scarring. Many apply toothpaste, garlic or neem on pimples, believing that these would reduce the inflammation, but in some cases using such items may lead to skin irritation and inflammation. They may even cause a superficial burn,\u201d says dermatologist Dr Zubin Mandlewala of Reflectionz Clinic.", "Instead:", "\u201cConsult a doctor, so he or she may assess the root cause of the acne. This could be hormonal, caused by some cosmetics or because of the consumption of high glycaemic foods, or one\u2019s occupation and lifestyle may even be what\u2019s at the root of the problem,\u201d says Dr Mandlewala. Acne can be of two types: noninflammatory (white heads and black heads) and inflammatory (red and/or pus-filled pimples). \u201cDepending on the type, it must be treated with topical creams, gels, oral medications, and, if necessary, certain procedures,\u201d says Dr Mandlewala.", "OTC FUNGAL INFECTION CREAMS", "Here\u2019s why:", "Dermatologist Dr Gayatri Bharadwaj explains, \u201cFungal infections typically manifest as an itchy rash, generally in the folds of the skin. Most people are not aware of the dangers of using OTC creams to treat these and are desperate for instant relief. But, many such products contain steroids that damage the skin and/ or cause thinning of the skin, redness, acne, scars and stretch marks. Besides, superficial blood vessels become visible with prolonged use of these. And, furthermore, long-term use may cause serious side-effects like kidney damage, growth retardation in children, bone loss, swelling of the body, diabetes, depression, psychosis and memory loss,\u201d she says. And, for all that, these don\u2019t even cure fungal infections; the problem will resurface as soon as the treatment is discontinued.", "Instead:", "\u201cOpt for proper antifungal creams or oral medication, which should be prescribed by a qualified dermatologist. And, preventive measures help, for example, keep the affected area totally dry and wear loose cotton clothes as sweating worsens this condition,\u201d says Dr Bharadwaj.", "WAXING FACIAL HAIR", "Here\u2019s why:", "\u201cWaxing the face can damage the epidermis and may cause hair follicles to get infected (folliculitis). Also, repeated waxing can cause the skin to turn dark,\u201d says skin specialist Dr Rasya Dixit.", "Instead:", "\u201cThough expensive, laser hair removal is a good alternative, as the laser only affects the hair and doesn\u2019t damage the skin,\u201d she says.", "HAIR-REMOVAL TECHNIQUES FOR GIRLS", "Here\u2019s why:", "Many girls under the age of 10 years complain of excessive hair growth these days. \u201cHowever, laser hair removal treatments or any other hair removal techniques are pointless at this time. For one thing, the skin is too delicate. Besides, post puberty there will be a change in the hair cycle, so even if the girl has gone through a laser treatment, the hair will grow back. Besides, if the child has any hormonal imbalance, the hair may grow back thicker,\u201d warns Dr Krupa Amonkar, consulting dermatologist, Palkar\u2019s Polyclinic.", "Instead:", "If your daughter is adamant about having hair removal treatments, \u201cyou may reduce the frequency of these by using solutions to reduce hair growth, such as eflonithin creams. These prolong the hair cycle, i.e. the hair takes longer to grow back,\u201d says Dr Amonkar.", "ANTI-AGEING CREAMS", "Here\u2019s why:", "Ageing skin is the result of multiple factors \u2014 constant, cumulative sun exposure, an erratic lifestyle and genetics are some of these. Due to these, collagen and elastin get depleted from the deeper layers of skin and this causes signs of ageing like wrinkles, open pores and coarse, rough skin. \u201cThe idea that a topical anti-ageing cream will correct these issues that arise due to problems that run far deeper, has no basis in logic,\u201d says Dr Madhuri Agarwal, founder and medical director of Yavana Aesthetics Clinic.", "Instead:", "\u201cIdeally, to keep your skin looking young and supple for longer, it is advised to start a healthy skin care regimen from the age of 25,\u201d says Dr Agarwal. \u201cAlso, consume a balanced diet, loaded with antioxidants, proteins and micronutrients as these help repair the internal environment, which cause signs of ageing. Antioxidants also reduce the damage caused by stress and pollutants etc. Sun exposure is the main reason that Indians age so rapidly, so use sunscreens, even when indoors.\u201d Additionally, she recommends using serums with Vitamin C and retinol for normal to oily skin, and \u201cIf you have dry skin, use moisturisers with these plus hyaluronic acid as these ingredients hydrate and prevent ageing. Also, consume at least two to three litres of water daily, as dry skin looks older.\u201d Dr Agarwal adds, \u201cOnce your skin starts to look aged, reversing the damage may require a combination of medical products or cosmeceuticals and aesthetic treatments involving lasers, radiofrequency, botox, dermal fillers and threadlift. We even use these to keep the signs of ageing at bay nowadays.\u201d", "\u2588 When one pops a pimple, the action damages the skin, leading to hyperpigmentation (darkening) and it may even leave a scar", "\u2014 Dr Zubin Mandlewala", "\u2588 Waxing the hair on the face can cause damage to the epidermis or upper layer of skin, and may cause hair follicles to get infected (folliculitis)", "\u2014 Dr Rasya Dixit", "GALLERIES", "View more photos", "Maharashtra vs Karnataka Ranji Day 1", "In Pics: India vs New Zealand 2nd ODI in Pune, New Zealand bats", "Tulsibaug Ganpati", "Pune Celebrates Onam", "Pune festival: Inaugural Function", "Ganesh Chaturthi 2017: Immersion at Pune", "Mumbai Mirror", "Ahmedabad Mirror", "Bangalore Mirror", "Times of India", "Economic Times", "Bombay Times", "E-paper", "M-Paper", "Lifehacker India", "Cricbuzz", "Marathi News", "Miss Kyra", "Gizmodo India", "HappyTrips", "Weekend Getaways from Mumbai", "Times Now", "ET Now", "Zoom TV", "Mirror Now", "Times Now", "ET Now", "About Us", "Advertise with us", "Terms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy", "Privacy Policy", "Copyright  \u00a9", "Bennett, Coleman & Co.

She was a candidate to run civil rights under the US Department of Justice in the Trump administration. (What a story that would have been for women of colour.) Ultimately the job went to another lawyer, Eric Dreiband. (Yup. White. Male.) Dhillon blames the \u201cswamp\u201d in Washington and says she wants to serve her country \u201cat the right place and time\u201d.", "Dhillon\u2019s parents, Parminder Kaur Dhillon and Tejpal Singh Dhillon, moved to the US in the early 70s from Chandigarh. She was two. She grew up in rural North Carolina where she attended a science and mathematics institute, but then picked law because it was \u201cmore interesting\u201d. Early on she made common cause with free-speech champions. One of her first brushes with fame (or notoriety) came in the late 80s as the editor of Dartmouth College\u2019s conservative students\u2019 weekly, which carried an article likening Dartmouth\u2019s (Jewish) president to Hitler for his alleged anti-conservative policies. The paper was", "flayed", "for being anti-Semitic, though Dhillon vehemently opposed the charge. She shot to greater prominence when the paper won a lawsuit against the college concerning a previous fracas\u2014a victory that landed her on 60 Minutes.", "Notwithstanding her conservative roots, Dhillon became a board member at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which one of her interviewers dubbed \u201cthe nemesis of most conservatives\u201d. In", "that interview", ", Dhillon calls herself \u201ca minority on the board of the ACLU\u201d as well as \u201ca minority in the Republican Party\u201d for her stand on certain issues, such as the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. More recently, Dhillon has stood up for Berkeley College Republicans, who wanted to host a speech by Ann Coulter, a controversial right-wing author. She also represents", "James Damore", ", the engineer Google fired for his allegedly misogynistic memo. You might be more familiar with another of her clients: Sandeep Aggarwal, co-founder of Indian e-commerce unicorn ShopClues, founder of automobile marketplace Droom, and now a reality TV star, who briefly went to prison in the US on insider trading charges.", "But Dhillon is making probably her biggest contribution in elevating the profile of Sikh Americans. In one of her best-known cases, she represented Trilochan Oberoi, a Sikh man who was denied a job as a prison guard in California unless he shaved off his beard. Dhillon won him a substantial settlement and another job in the corrections department. She is also unabashed about using her political pedestal to promote awareness of Sikhism. Notwithstanding her tough-cookie reputation, Dhillon says her strength comes from the humanist Sikh values she got in her childhood. \u201cIf you know your Sikh history, you would know that even on the battlefields, our leaders would give water to the fallen soldiers on the other side,\u201d she tells Economictimes.com, sitting in a colourful if chaotic chamber at the offices of her firm Dhillon Law Group on San Francisco\u2019s Post Street. Edited excerpts from a wide-ranging chat:", "Are we reaching a boiling point when it comes to the free-speech debate?", "Well, no. When I was in college 30 years ago I was in a running battle with the administration over free-speech issues on campus. There were constant disputes, without the [recent] addition of the violent left. We didn\u2019t have gangs of masked criminals and domestic terrorists attacking people in the streets like we do in Berkeley today.", "What we have today is a very liberal political leadership in some cities on the West coast, Portland, Berkeley, some others, that don\u2019t want to be seen as politically incorrect, and they don\u2019t do their basic job of law enforcement. Violent suppression of speech should not be tolerated on any side.", "Let\u2019s step back a little. These two words\u2014liberal and conservative\u2014are thrown around a lot, often without much clarity. How would you define these words today?", "I consider myself a classical liberal with a small \u2018l\u2019. I believe in the rights of the individual and that people are responsible for their own actions and not for some collective good or what have you.", "What capital \u2018L\u2019 Liberal means today is socialism, in California and some other parts of the country it means illegal immigration, AKA open-door immigration. It means the rights of criminals are elevated over the rights of law-abiding citizens. It means that the government should steal from the rich and give it to the poor, basically.", "Conservatives today are what I consider to be the classical liberals. They believe that people should be responsible for their own actions by and large. That the role of the government in our lives should be very limited to the essential aspects that are required to maintain physical order and perform basic functions. Water, clean air to a certain extent, roads, close the borders, make sure people are protected from crime. Beyond that the government has a limited role in regulating things, controlling our speech, telling us what to do with our own property, etc.", "Increasingly, here in California, which is very liberal, taxes keep going up on the successful people. Business owners like myself have to deal with more and more regulations. Half the state doesn\u2019t pay taxes. People like you and me who follow the law are at the back of the line. I have clients who are here with an H1B visa, they\u2019d like to get their green card, they\u2019ve been waiting in the queue for seven years. But if you just cross the border illegally, you can have", "DACA", "and all the rights of citizenship. So we have a really fractured society in that regard.", "You spoke of regulation. The Bay Area, especially the tech industry, is right at the heart of the debate around regulation in business.", "The government has a role to make sure citizens aren\u2019t cheated. Having the corporate form is a privilege granted by the state, separate from, say, my right to bear arms or own property, which are natural rights enshrined in our Constitution. If the government gives you some rights, it can also impose some restrictions. You can\u2019t lie or sell security under false pretences. You can\u2019t limit the right of citizens to challenge your illegal activities by various clauses in your contract \u2026", "Regulation of new-fangled businesses is a hot-button topic in India as well\u2026 In your country, it\u2019s a fairly new regime. Just 20 years ago, it was a semi-socialist country. Now it is so-called capitalist without the regulatory framework to keep people honest. Frankly, there is a whole culture of dishonesty in India. That\u2019s the reason my parents left India. They didn\u2019t want to bribe someone to get a telephone.", "In the US, we do have examples of dishonest behaviour but they are not tolerated. Any little guy can find a lawyer and sue a company and hold it accountable. So you do have an Enron or an Equifax. Equifax made a mistake but then it covered up, and the board profited from it. I don\u2019t think the company is going to be around in six months, frankly.", "What is the best way for an immigrant to contribute to American life in 2017?", "Everyone has their own way. I am very active in the Sikh community, because it is important to me that Sikhs don\u2019t suffer discrimination in the workplace etc. You can do that as a lawyer, standing up for your clients in a court on a pro-bono basis. Or you can do that via politics. When there\u2019s a Sikh doing the prayer at the convention like I did, when it\u2019s in your face like that, it\u2019s very hard for people to ignore you, or say they don\u2019t know who you are.", "That\u2019s why I became the first Indian-American to contest the election for the state assembly. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to win, it was a very tough district right here where we are sitting. But it was a chance to tell hundreds of thousands of California residents about Sikhs.", "Let\u2019s talk about the James Damore case. What were your first thoughts when you were approached for it?", "The essential question with any employment litigation is not whether I personally identify with the client, but whether they have a case under the law. I am a woman with a tech background. I went to the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. I am not intimidated by science and tech. But I made a different choice for my career. Not because I was discriminated against, but because I found law more interesting. Women in America have a lot of choices. That\u2019s the point James is [also making].", "Importantly, the context isn\u2019t there in the memo itself. The context is, Google has frequent indoctrination sessions for its employees that hammer into your head that if your team doesn\u2019t have 50% women in it, it\u2019s because your boss is discriminatory, we are all discriminatory, and we must all self-flagellate, and we must use quotas to achieve parity.", "At the end of each session, everyone is asked for feedback. [What James wrote] was solicited feedback. We have all worked in corporates. You know that if you have a mandatory diversity training in your company where you are told \u2018we don\u2019t have enough people of colour or enough women in our company; any feedback?\u2019, they probably don\u2019t want to hear your feedback (laughs). But James took them at face value and wrote down his feedback. He did it a second time and sent it to the HR. He did not get any response. So he posted his feedback on one of Google\u2019s internal forums about workplace issues. One of his colleagues didn\u2019t like it and sent it to the media. James didn\u2019t send it to the media. US labour law under the National Labor", "Relations Act protects the speech in question. You are allowed to discuss the terms and conditions of your workplace with other workers, even if your employer doesn\u2019t agree with you. Are quotas illegal? In India they are very common, but here in the US, quotas aren\u2019t allowed with very few exceptions. If you are an industry with a history of discrimination, then you are allowed to use differential pay to correct existing imbalances. If you simply think it will be desirable to have more X, Y, or Z, well you cannot do that at the expense of other people; we all have rights.", "Interestingly, Google [has also] got sued for not paying their women software engineers enough. A reporter asked me, doesn\u2019t this prove that Google does in fact discriminate against women? I replied that these two things can both be true together: It is possible that Google uses discrimination to buff up its diversity numbers while also not paying certain women equally. These are complex issues. Unfortunately, the Twitterverse reduces everything to 140 characters. And so James was turned into this horrible pariah, whereas everything he said is legally protected and defensible.*", "Assuming you are able to defend Damore legally, are you worried at all about the morality of what he wrote?", "To every woman who has suffered discrimination, the subject is obviously very personal. But it\u2019s become a political mantra that even those women who aren\u2019t discriminated against use as a weapon. Sometimes you get a bad review in the workplace because you didn\u2019t do a good job. As a lawyer, I probably get 10 calls a day from people who want to sue their employers. Seven out of those 10 claims are probably without merit legally. Not because they don\u2019t feel hurt or think that their boss is a jerk, but because they don\u2019t have a case unless they have been discriminated against based on who they are.", "Frankly, America is by far the most egalitarian and pluralistic nation in the world, and it is not because of indoctrination sessions. From day 1 in a public school you are taught that the little kid in the turban is the same as you and you have to treat him as your equal. People here try to be fair and decent. No country is perfect, but we start from a better place than most countries.", "How do you see the Indian-American community evolving from the IIT brain bank narrative?", "Umm, the IIT brain bank is actually a fairly recent phenomenon. Sikhs have been living in California for over a century doing farming and labour jobs. My father came here as a doctor during the Vietnam War. Anybody who could get out of Punjab was getting out during the Indira Gandhi years.", "For the young people today \u2026 well there is actually a lot of opportunity back home. So you can take it (the conditions to migrate to the US) or leave it. In the Silicon Valley area for one, living costs are extremely high, there\u2019s this semi-corrupt environment morally in my opinion. I don\u2019t have children, but if I had them...", "Why do you say Silicon Valley is semi-corrupt?", "I mean \u2026 there is no distinction between genders for instance, which I think is artificial and wrong. Children are being taught at six years of age in some school districts that transgender is an equally valid choice as anything else.", "I think it is a fairly complex topic for six-year- olds. So public schools here have a lot of significant issues. I would probably not send my own children to a public school in San Francisco.", "Right\u2026", "People are all over the place. There are a lot of things said [about the Valley], like \u2018this is the American Dream blah blah blahh, that you get access to a lot of capital without too many strings attached. [But] I have some friends who are entrepreneurs and are successful in India, like my client Sandeep Aggarwal. Young people there have options now.", "[Having said that,] without the proper regulatory framework, I would worry about the investors in some of these new companies [in India]. I mean if you invest in one of them, and the entrepreneur steals the money, buys a yacht with it or whatever, can you approach the Indian courts and get accountability? I don\u2019t think so. Not the way you can get in America. Frankly, you could offer me a billion dollars to go live in India and I wouldn\u2019t. I value my freedom and my ability to be who I am in America.", "For someone who has very strong views, you have defied narrow labels. Do you reflect on the choices you have made in your life?", "Labels are for small minds. I believe in the values that were given to me in my childhood. We Sikhs care very deeply about the equality of men and women, of different faiths. We don\u2019t impose our views on others, unlike some other faiths that proselytise or look down upon others or call them \u2018untouchables\u2019 or whatever. I have every kind of people in my firm. We don\u2019t discriminate based on sexual orientation or faith or whatever.", "The people who didn\u2019t like your prayer at the Republican Convention\u2014perhaps for them it was not an act of faith but a political act ?", "What it was, was an act of tens of millions of people seeing a Sikh prayer. It doesn\u2019t happen if you are a little side show in the White House, which is what most Democrat Sikhs are. President Obama gave us a little room to have a kirtan at the White House. Who\u2019s seeing that? Nobody was doing a Sikh prayer on primetime television. I took the opportunity, and 99% of the people are happy that I did. Who cares about the 1% naysayers?", "If you boycott the party in power, your voices are not going to be heard about Sikhs in the military, about our right to practice our religion. You don\u2019t get heard by begging but by hard work and by paying your dues, and some people don\u2019t want to do that.", "Almost a year into the Trump presidency, what do you make of the president?", "I feel the president is sincerely attempting to honour his commitments to the people. He is not a politician, and that shows in good ways and bad ways. If he were a politician he would have done a lot of things a lot more smoothly. He would have been able to cut some deals with the Congress on some issues, which he hasn\u2019t been able to.", "I blame the Congress for that, they are the political professionals and they have paid lip service to tax reforms, Obamacare, building the wall, securing our borders. And then when the president was willing to do all those things, they made excuses. I think the president means well. I support him completely; I only wish he had better advisors and a more cooperative Congress.", "You could have been one of them.", "You know, there is a swamp. People who live inside the Beltway or inside the clogged arteries of New Delhi, they get the government job. And if you are a person who wants to live in San Francisco and has an ongoing law practice \u2026 it comes down to how badly you want the job. Do you want it badly enough to change your values or get down into the dirt with the swamp folks? I want to help my country at the right time and place. So I am very proud and happy to support the president as a commentator on television, as a leader in my party, and as a member of the Republican National Committee. It\u2019s an honour for me to be able to do that, and I view it as a purely voluntary contribution as a citizen. Some other members of the party are lobbyists, they represent clients to affect particular legislations etc. I don\u2019t do that. I haven\u2019t taken a penny as a lobbyist.", "*A Google spokesperson offered the following statement on the Damore case to economictimes.com:", "\u201cWe have strong policies against retaliation, harassment and discrimination in the workplace.

What we have today at the end of the year is evidence about how agriculture, banking, budget were all affected by the move and also how it did nothing to curb the black economy or control terrorism. The worst sufferers of this move, however, were the micro enterprises of the country.", "Rajiv Chawla, President of Faridabad Small Industries Association, says, \"While demonetisation brought many small industries closer to digitalisation, the micro industries had to go through an unstable phase. They were neither prepared for it, nor were they a part of the black economy to begin with. A dholwala at a wedding, a dhaba owner at the roadside, a plumber, or a daily wage earner - all of them earn in cash and are not familiar with credit cards, phone and net banking. Demonetisation brought a huge lull in their businesses.\"", "The small and medium enterprises, on the other hand became more organised, according to him. He explains, \"Demonetisation has disciplined the", "SMEs", ". They are more organised and digital friendly now,\" says Chawla.", "However, Chawla says there is evidence that business has systematically moved from smaller firms to bigger, more organized players. It started with demonitisation where smaller players that did not have card machines or mobile wallets saw a huge dip in business. \"Businesses that were in remote location without access to the Internet, suffered greatly. It was like an earthquake for them. After demonitisation a big chunk of the market moved to organized players and this drift started last year. You can see that while the economy had gone down, companies like Shoppers Stop and Big Bazaar grew,\" says Chawla.", "Estimates suggest SMEs in India constitutes 45% of the country's output and employs 60 million people. These businesses worth under Rs 10 crore in terms of investment in plant and machinery are mostly businesses run by families as a legacy. Most of their labour force is workers who have migrated from the interiors of the country to the cities. Coping with demonetisation was almost impossible for them. One of India's most renowned experts on black economy, Professor Arun Kumar, believes that demonetisation has been a complete failure for MSMEs. Kumar has researched and wrote about the black economy for decades and has also helped draft former Prime Minister VP Singh his election manifesto.", "He says, \"Most of the workers in the micro industries went back to the villages. The bicycle industries in Ludhiana, the brass industry in Moradabad, the diamond industry in Surat, were all devastatingly impacted by demonetisation. Many such businesses shut down because there was no cash to pay the workers. About 1,000 units in Jamshedpur that operated as a small scale ancillary unit to big industries were closed. The unorganised sector consists 45% of GDP. You cannot bring progress without caring for them. Rate of growth went down to almost 1%.\"", "According to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, sale of rice to rural mandis in the country had dropped to 61% and in many places winter crops last year could not even be sold because there was no cash to buy seeds.", "Informal to formal", "At the heart of the demonitisation was the penchant to convert the informal sector into the formal sector. In a speech in London this February, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said \"Demonetisation was a move to change the Indian normal... a new normal had to be created. A predominantly cash economy has now to be substituted with a digital economy, which will bring more money into the banking system and lead to better revenue generation; the integration of the informal economy with the more formal one is now taking place.\"", "To put it very simply, the informal sector represents small businesses that are generally not registered, incorporated and often outside the tax net.", "According to International Labour Organization (", "ILO", ") some of the characteristic features of employment in the informal sector are lack of protection in the event of non-payment of wages, compulsory overtime or extra shifts, layoffs without notice or compensation, unsafe working conditions and the absence of social benefits such as pensions, sick pay and health insurance. It would then seem alright for the Finance Minister to want businesses to move from informal to the formal sector.", "However, economics is rarely that simple and the informal sector may not be bad. There is evidence that suggest the informal sector is very important when it comes to riding out economic slowdown. When a slowdown strikes, the informal sector acts a cushion. The World Bank in one of its report has laid out the issue quite succinctly. \"To further complicate things, Keith Hart, the purported coiner of the term informality (and one who did not think the sector was necessarily bad), argued that the source of our blindness-the undocumented nature of the sector- left the sector especially vulnerable to being a tabula rasa on which analysts projected their particular concerns.\"", "According to ILO one of the foremost reasons for the informal sector to exist in a country is because of poverty and the limited livelihood opportunities and jobs for the working poor. \"Low incomes and limited access to public institutions prevent the poor from investing in skills that could boost their employability, productivity and ensure their protection from income shocks and risks,\" ILO says. Another factor driving informality is the inability of the industrial sector to absorb labour in more productive jobs.", "While there is a need to address the negative aspects of the informal sector, there is also a need to ensure the jobs linked to the sector are preserved. Businesses in the informal sector needs to be encouraged to join formal system, workers need to be protected and that can only happen through \"comprehensive and integrated strategy cutting across a range of policy,\" says ILO. Clearly, demonitisation does not seem to be the answer.", "Silver lining", "Not everyone is as fiercely against demonetisation though. As the country prepared to go cashless, digital wallets became extremely crucial. Mobile payment", "startups", "such as", "Paytm", "and", "MobiKwik", "rose to overnight stardom. Within two weeks after demonetisation was implemented, Paytm, in fact, got 20 million new users and seven million transactions per day.", "Within a month of demonetisation, MobiKwik too saw a 400% surge in transactions. Upasana Taku, co-founder of MobiKwik, says that the company treats the", "MSME", "sector seriously. She says, \"MobiKwik is a wallet for masses and is used for all use cases. Milk, Petrol, groceries and offline retail are our growing use cases. About 20% of our transactions come from semi-urban and rural users. Our tie up with BSNL is an initiative to include semi-urban and rural India into the digital payments economy. With this co-branded wallet, the ease of payment will be extended to all the customers while equally strengthening financial inclusion in the rural hinterlands, which often get neglected.\"", "While Taku also says that MobiKwik is an RBI approved wallet and is PCI-DSS and ISO27001 Certified, taking care of the various Information Security measures to ensure the safety of its business as well as users, the larger question probably is whether for India to embrace digital technology, attain developed infrastructure, or rising growth rate projection, demonetisation mattered at all? All of those objectives could have been achieved without banning high denomination currency.", "Take the case of Instamojo. Last year, Instamojo witnessed an 82% growth in merchant registrations in the month of November and 2x growth in December. However, according to Sampad Swain, theCEO and Co-founder of the company, out of the total merchant sign-ups between November 2016- March 2017, only 30% SMEs continued to use digital payments as of October 2017. Headquartered in Bangalore, Instamojo provides integrated solutions to over 3, 00,000 SMEs and offers link-based on demand payments to SMEs.", "Potential energy", "Two of the fundamental objectives of demonetisation were to curb black economy and forbid counterfeiting currency which is largely used for terrorism. The micro enterprises of the country do not have an association with both to begin with. They run on cash and one of the biggest misnomers associated with demonetisation was the presumption that cash leads to black money. The failure to distinguish among black money, black income and black wealth has led to catastrophic results in the MSME sector. It led to unemployment, farmer protests, a growing social divide, postponement of weddings, unable to pay healthcare bills, and so much more.", "The damage has been done. On what the road ahead for the people as well as the MSMEs of the country is, R Gopalakrishnan, an Executive Director at", "Tata Sons", ", says, \"If you study the case history of successful and unsuccessful change/ transformation, there is considerable weightage to how the change is implemented, at least as much as the idea of what the change is. Demonetisation,", "GST", "and such concepts are undoubtedly transformative as ideas, but that is only the potential. The potential energy needs to be converted into kinetic energy. The political squabbles and babble are noise. Focused action to solve issues is the signal that the public must watch for.\"", "0", "Comments", "Are you a Business Owner?

Filled with fun songs and a rich atmosphere, the film is a visual and emotional delight.", "Utterly genuine in concept, assembling and execution, it is an adventure film that casts a magical spell on its viewers -- kids and adults alike -- making them true believers in the human spirit.", "Set in the fictional village of Santa Cecilia in Mexico and narrated from a shoeshine boy", "Miguel", "'s point of view, the film is a shrewdly enduring piece of storytelling whose theme centres on family and dreams.", "Miguel is inclined towards music and hopes to become a musician like his idol -- the legendary singer and song-writer Ernesto de la Cruz. But he is forbidden by his family to pursue his hobby simply because his great-great grandfather -- \"his great grandma -", "Coco", "'s dad\" -- a musician, had deserted his family. Instead he is coaxed to join his family shoe business.", "Miguel realises that his only chance to fulfil his dream is by participating in the singing competition which is to take place on 'Dia de los Muertos' -- 'The day of the dead' -- where the Mexican families celebrate the dead by honouring and remembering their ancestors. And as we see, the ancestors who are thus remembered come back to visit for the day.", "On the day of the celebrations, Miguel accidentally damages his Grandma Imelda's ofrenda, a ritual offering which consists of a photograph with the ripped out visage of his great-great grandfather and stumbles upon the part of a photograph that reveals a guitar in his hands.", "Seeing that the guitar is similar to that of Ernesto's, he believes he is a direct descendant of the great musician. And, as he borrows Ernesto's guitar to perform in the contest, he is sucked into the land of the dead, where he meets his ancestors. How he discovers new things about life, death and the importance of family, forms the crux of the tale.", "The plot weaves not only about the love of music, but also the desire to be remembered and the importance of remembering. It is a two-sided coin in which Miguel learns the importance of both.", "Colourful and imaginative, the film is a roller coaster-ride of emotions. Wrapped in a richly complex theme that is dark to an extent, the storytelling is heart-warmingly twisty. The first act is enticing. The second act drags with cliches that spin on their head. And the third act is fulfilling.", "As always with", "Pixar", "films, the computer animation with vibrant colours is at its seductive best.

Is it to publicly show that you are committed to giving back?", "Rohini Nilekani:", "We have been talking about this for a while, but it took me, more than Nandan, some time to agree to publicly declare this. Not because we were not planning to give away so much of our", "wealth", ". We always were. But it isn\u2019t easy to give it away, and I felt that now is the time when Nandan also has more time to focus on this. It requires both of us to be able to do it well.", "We have matured over the years, and we can now work strategically to do it better. So, we felt the timing was right to make the pledge.", "Q. Why the decision to sign the pledge after returning to the corporate sector?", "Nandan Nilekani:", "That is just a coincidence. This has been in the works for several months now. As Rohini said, I think what the giving pledge has done is that it has also brought together a set of philanthropists, and that creates a forum where you can share the best practices. A forum where you can collaborate over larger social issues. In that sense, it is a very effective forum, and that is as valuable as saying that we have just signed the pledge. Giving was already part of our DNA. It has always been there. But this was a way to become part of a group that was looking at the same kind of problems worldwide.", "Talking philanthropy:", "Bill Gates", "in conversation with Rohini and Nandan Nilekani.

Was there a conversation with them about this?", "Rohini Nilekani:", "To begin with, we do not fully believe that this wealth belongs to us. To be honest, both Nandan and I feel that we have been very lucky. A lot of luck is involved in creating so much wealth, and so we definitely feel that we are trustees of this, and not owners. The children have known this from the beginning, and they too are very interested in big ideas and philanthropy. There was never any question of them feeling entitled to the wealth. They have been fully supportive, hence, it has been an easy decision for us.", "Q. How has the meaning of money evolved for you over the years?", "Nandan Nilekani:", "I think money, after a point, is just about the choices it brings. It gives you the flexibility to address issues.

So, if that happens, it will come as a pleasant surprise to me and the markets.", "Edited excerpts:", "What is your view on India vis-vis Trump\u2019s policies and threat to globalisation?", "If the US really does go ahead with the border adjustment tax and if it was applied to services as well as manufactured goods that would be a big negative for these outsourcing models but the fact is we do not know if it is going to go ahead with it or not. So it remains uncertain. But all this risk makes me want to concentrate on portfolios in Asia and emerging markets which are primarily domestic demand stories. My long held view remains that India is the best domestic demand story.", "I am retaining a big weight on domestic demand stocks in India but I am not betting on IT, pharma stocks. I am betting on the capex geared areas and I am basically owning the domestic demand areas. These stocks are less impacted by any potential threat to globalisation. But it needs to be stressed that if the Trump administration does not go ahead with its border adjustment tax and if it is just a question of tax cuts to try and get the $2.5 trillion US corporate cash estimates outside of America, back into America, then that is not a big threat to globalisation. So the devil is in the detail in terms of the policies announced. As of today, it remains unclear.", "How much of the current appreciation in global equities is a pure function of change in allocation? The bull market in bonds is clearly getting over which is forcing money managers to move out of fixed income and move back to equities?", "While there is an element of that going on, there is a growing consensus that the bull market in government bonds and US treasury bonds which has been in going on for 35 years is over. The bull market in US treasury bonds began in 1981. More and more people think that it is over. However, it needs to be stressed that there is no technical evidence that the bull market in bonds is over.", "If you draw a trend line from the beginning of the US treasury bond bull market on the 10-year yield, the top of the trend line is just above 3%. Today when I last checked, the 10-year yield was 2.4%. So to have technical evidence that the bull market is over you need a convincing break of that 3% level and that evidence is not in. It is premature to conclude that the bull market in treasury bonds is over and part of that will depend precisely on the policies implemented by the Trump administration.", "You have always liked India and as per your latest model portfolio, you are overweight on India. Is it likely to remain this way or are you now worried about run up in Indian stocks and valuations looking stretched?", "My long only Asia ex-Japan portfolio recommendations has about 25 stocks and more than 50% in Indian domestic stocks are in that portfolio. Frankly I own the stocks that were hit most directly by demonetisation but the good news for my portfolio is these stocks have rebounded strongly in recent months since demonetisation. Technically, there is probably a case to take some profits in some of these domestic names which have good runs but as this is a long term portfolio, I am not going to do big profit taking. I still think India is the best domestic demand long term story. I am continuing to focus in areas like financial areas, I am hoping and expecting that demonetisation will be a positive for the long term promotion of use of financial assets in India and I am taking the view that the demonetisation initiative is a positive not a negative.", "In the past, you have had concerns about the fact that Indian investments cycle or the capex cycle is yet to pick up and unfortunately it is yet to pick up. So, are you a bit worried about inward looking sectors, domestic looking sectors which still rely on the pickup in the capex cycle?", "I am not expecting a pickup in the capex cycle in the new fiscal year approaching in India and I have not got capex geared names in my portfolio and I would not be overweight on them. The only good news is that no one else is now expecting a pickup in capex in India in the new financial year. So, if that happens, it will come as a pleasant surprise to me and the markets.", "The key reason for the delay in capex recovery is the overhang of stressed loans in the banking system. These problems would be addressed in a very slow way which means the overhang will continue and the investment cycle will be delayed but the positive side is that the stressed nature of 70% of the banking system means that the highly rated private sector banks have a huge opportunity to continue to increase their market share and the demonetisation, the electronic ID card clearly creates potential for promotion of digital banking. Anyway, I am not in the capex orientated area.", "I notice that finally you have a buy or preference towards Bank of Baroda which happens to be a PSU bank. In the past, you have raised concerns about Indian PSU banks and their opaque book quality. Are you getting convinced that at least the 2-3 large PSU banks have done their bit and they are available cheap?", "Well one is hoping that they are getting more proactive about recognising problem loans. So, that is the good news. The risk is they may be forced to merge with more distressed franchises. I would not want to have my whole banking position in PSU banks. My core focus remains the private sector banks.", "Do you think the challenges which Indian IT companies are facing, are they real or it is time to be contra buy in Indian IT companies?", "From relative valuations, they are probably looking attractive but personally from a long-term basis, they are not in my core theme in owning India. Also we need to see what the US administration is going to announce or not announce on this whole issue of potential protectionist action, potential tax on outsourcing. Hopefully none of this happens but we cannot be sure.", "The fact that Indian IT companies are now considering a buyback, some of them have announced a buyback, some of them are about to announce a buyback, is that tempting enough for you to relook at them because if they do a buyback successfully the return ratios would increase significantly?", "In an India dedicated portfolio, clearly you would own some of these companies on a relative valuation basis but in my portfolio I have only got 25 stocks in Asia and that is not my core area or focus.", "You have always like Indian HFCs, Names like HDFC Ltd, Gruh Finance, Indiabull Housing Finance, do you think the current government\u2019s focus on low cost housing and housing will ensure that the growth highway for HFCs in India will remain strong?", "I am assuming housing finance is a core area of growth in India. The budget came up with the expected news of trying to promote the housing market, especially the lower cost housing area. Clearly, the demonetisation approach has negative implications for the real estate sector. You also have got a very important regulation being introduced to the real estate sector which in my view is merited and long overdue and that is going to lead to dramatic consolidation in the property sector. You are going to get many developers going out of business because of the much tougher requirements but I view the housing finance companies as a core long-term hold and the best quality property developers will be the winners from the dramatic consolidations that is going to hit the real estate market.", "If I insist that you have to choose between Indian private banks and HFCs, which way would you lean?", "I will probably lean to the former.", "Any specific reason?", "Well only because if you are in one or the other, then one is a more pure macro play right, but I think it is a close call. I do not have an extreme view of that which is I own both areas in long only Asia ex-Japan portfolio. I should add by the way that I have started this portfolio as long ago as October 2002. I have basically always had private sector banks in India in this portfolio.", "Any specific reason that you are giving consumer staples still a pass?", "Right now, they are out of fashion because the fashion amongst global investors is to buy cheap cyclical names and avoid expensive growth. There is going be a concern in terms of the rural orientated staples that you will see. You have not seen the full impact of demonetisation yet but to me they are just not the most interesting \u2013 though they are a perfectly good story. I have owned such names in the past and I am not hugely negative. But in the short term, it is probably premature to assume that you have seen all the impact of the demonetisation on these areas, particularly rural consumer staples.", "Any specific reason why property stocks have been a constant part of your portfolio. When you say you have only 25 stocks in your portfolio, you are being highly selective here, and Indian real estate companies in the past have had some issues but you continue to prefer and like Indian real estate stocks. That has been a constant feature of this portfolio?", "The Indian real estate sector has got a very low market capitalisation compared to say the Chinese real estate sector or the Hong Kong real estate sector or the Japanese real estate sector. There is huge long-term growth potential but it has been a bit of a morality tale the Indian real estate property sector. Initially the right approach was to buy the high beta names when this whole real estate cycle first kicked in 10 years ago or more but right now, the the long term issue is to pick, to concentrate portfolios in those developers whom you view will be able to deal with this dramatic change in the business model, where so far as I understand , the new rules will say that if you are a developer launching a project you have to put 90% of the presales revenue into Escrow. To my mind, that is going to be a very tough requirement and only certain property developers will be able to do that . The developers who have got a track record for completing projects in the past and have got the balance sheet to deal with those new tough rules are going to be long-term winners. It is going to be a long term story.", ".", "You have always liked Indian banks with retail franchise -- whether it is HDFC Bank or IndusInd Bank. Will it remain this way or do you now prefer banks which are corporate in nature with a wholesale balance sheet?", "I am tilted towards household deposit driven banks and hope that they continue to take market share of the public sector banks. The other expectation is that advances in technology will allow them to move more proactively into digital banking particularly in rural, less developed areas.", "But do you think the challenge for something like HDFC Bank could be that a) it is expensive and b) the FII limit is frozen, so new buyers cannot enter till the time old buyers sell out?", "Well yes, that has been the same story for 10 years and more. If you are a new buyer today that is obviously an issue.", "If you have to isolate one big prediction for 2017 and beyond and if you have to identify a mega trend whether local or global, what would it be?", "One, there is a question mark on globalisation but as we do not know the details of the policies, we do not want to get too alarmed as yet but there is clearly that risk. In terms of emerging markets, a positive important point to note is that I have gone overweight on China in the last few months and the key reason for that is that the PPI that has been negative in China since early 2012, has turned positive in China in the last two quarters. I went to Beijing in December and I became more hopeful that supply side discipline, supply side reform will continue in China because we saw production cuts in steel and coal in China last year. My base case is that the supply side discipline will continue and that is a big positive for anybody involved in sectors such as steel, coal, etc, globally. The upstream sectors in China continue to improve because of this supply side reforms and as a result, the reported asset quality in the Chinese banking system will improve too.", "My story does hinge on the supply discipline continuing in China.", "You have mentioned in your reports and in your notes that you expect oil producers to maintain some degree of discipline yet you are not very optimistic on crude. Why is that?", "In the last several months, Saudi Arabia did a total u-turn on its policy towards oil. It went from flooding the market to try and undermine shale to renewed production discipline and that strategy in my view is to try and keep oil above $50 in the run up to them listing their oil company. But the long term risk to oil is precisely because they are keeping oil up in the $50-60 range. That will mean that shale production in America will come roaring back. So there is going to be a dramatic increase in supply in the US and that means that in the long term, oil is going down again. But oilSaudi will definitely be determined to keep oil above $50 before they do their IPO. The key point is when they are going to do the IPO and you want to sell oil the day they do it.", "In the past you have indicated to your readers and to our viewers that gold should be a must own part of key portfolios, would you like to maintain that view?", "I maintain that view for global investors. In India\u2019s case, it is rather different. In India\u2019s case there is a tradition of holding gold. The Indian government under Prime Minister Modi is trying to promote very sensibly the use of financial assets. So in India, if the policy of demonetisation and making financial assets is successful, I can see demand for gold decline on a secular basis. I can see a generational change to the attitude towards gold. I do think the Indian situation is strictly bullish for gold.", "But from a global perspective, you need to maintain a position in gold because you have had extreme monetary policy practices in the developed world in recent years. We also had a further huge increase in at least seven government debt to GDP ratio. Just to take example of America, the former government debt to GDP ratio in America is 104%. It was only 30% when Ronal Reagan entered the White House in 1980 and you had Fannie and Freddie alone to the government debt GDP. Most people would assume that Fannie and Freddie debt is in reality a US government debt, that adds another 30 percentage points more to total government debt to GDP. So with these extreme monetary and fiscal easing, I believe you have to own gold.", "Also gold ultimately will win either way, either Donald Trump\u2019s reflationary protectionist policies will work in the sense that they get traction cyclically in which case inflation will pick up in America or they do not work in which case you get a reality check and you are going to get more unconventional monetary policy in America.", "When it comes to Indian equity markets, do you think a) long term sustainable and secular bull market has started in India or Indian markets from these levels at max would give 8-9% compounded returns?", "Well for the long term secular bull market story to be valid we will need at some point an investment cycle but for me my base case is we are in that long term secular bull market and if we do not get the investment cycle in the next fiscal year, I would be proved wrong. I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.", "0", "Comments", "Comments", "Add Your Comments", "Most Read", "Most Shared", "Most Commented", "Chris Wood predicts BJP win in Gujarat, says a loss will be Modi\u2019s Waterloo", "Blue chips too can deliver big!

responsible for ionising the universe, but not all agree this is the sole cause.", "Since Earth's atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light, it is impossible to study this type of radiation from the
